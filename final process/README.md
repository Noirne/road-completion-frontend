# Final result processing

## Generating the database results

For processing the final result all records from the mongodb database are needed. 

```
# navigate to the backend folder
cd backend

# run the backup script
sudo sh backupdb.sh
```

This script will generate an output.json file inside the backend/mongodb/dump folder

## Processing the results

Make sure you have nodejs installed before running the following commands

For the processing 2 files are needed:
- output.geojson: generated in the host-share folder by the difference tool 
- output.json: generated by the database backup script

Copy both files to the `final process` folder.

```
# navigate to the final process folder
cd final\ process/

# install node modules
npm install

# run the processing script
node app.js
```

This will generate a new_output.geojson file. This output contains the status and userid + geometry of the data.
